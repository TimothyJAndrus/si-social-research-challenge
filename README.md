# A social research data science challenge

# Background

BrightHive is an impact-driven data technology start-up company using data trusts to transform the legal, technical, and cultural ways social services providers share data, make decisions, and affect the behavioral outcomes of beneficiaries. Together with our strategic partners, we build and support open-source interoperable data infrastructure necessary for national, state, and city governments and social and civic organizations to share data more effectively and securely, and build interventions that directly impact the lives of individuals.

One of the most important responsibilities of this role is the application of research and statistical analysis to develop recommendations for program or policy changes. Particular focus areas for BrightHive are K-12 education and national and state workforce.


# Data Science Take Home Challenge
## Overview: 
To help independently assess your qualifications and skill we have designed two self contained mini data science exercises, labeled “Adult Educational Attainment and Work” and “Grade 9-12 Education and Work Outcomes.”

Each exercise will involve a series of progressive steps, including data analysis, regression and explanation of results along with any policy recommendations as appropriate. The exercises contain an amount of functional overlap that encourages code reuse and architecture design across each exercise. The datasets are similar to what you might see in Strategic Initiatives.

The total start to finish time taken for this entire assignment, including both mini data science exercises, should not exceed four (4) hours but if you find yourself taking longer feel free to submit (using the instructions provided below) what you currently have and don’t stress since many different aspects of your application are holistically evaluated.

The sections that follow cover tool and time requirements as well as how to request and submit this take home assignment. We thank you for your time taken in starting this assignment and hope that you find it interesting.

## Tool Requirements: 
The product and engineering team at BrightHive uses Python, along with Git and Docker. However, this assignment will only focus on Python and Git. Please make sure that you have the following set up and/or installed:

* Your own Github.com account
* A programming IDE of your choice
* Python 3.x installed
* Git 2.8.1+ installed
* Access to Python 3 libraries for descriptive and statistical analysis, including regression
* A Python virtual environment to work in

## Time Expectations:
We expect this assignment to typically take 4 hours although some may finish sooner and others may finish later.

## Assignment Outputs:
* Several qualitative, descriptive analyses
* Several quantitative results written to a file
* Instructions for how to reproduce your results

## What to Expect: 
The assignment is a private GitHub repository that you will be invited into. 
Your work will be done on your own fork of the private repository.
The assignment consists of a series of analysis tasks across two data sets.
When you wish BrightHive to review your fork send a contributor invite to engineer@brighthive.io so that we may look at your work.
Be prepared to discuss your approach in a possible follow up call.

## How to Request the Assignment: 
Prior to the actual day that you wish to work on the assignment please send your github username to engineering@brighthive.io and indicate the date and time you wish to work on the assignment.
On or before the date and time expect to receive a BrightHive Github invite to the assignment repository.
If you receive the BrightHive Github invite before your date and time please do not accept it until the actual date and time you requested. 

## How to Submit the Assignment: 
In your private repository add engineering@brighthive.io as a contributing member with at least read access.
Please follow up with a quick email to engineering@brighthive.io and indicate that you are finished with assignment.

## Next Steps:
BrightHive Strategic Initiatives, Product and Engineering will review your submission and contact you if we wish to continue with next steps.
